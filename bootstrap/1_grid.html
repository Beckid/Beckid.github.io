1. Adobe Flash with ActionScript
This is a traditional way for developing web games. It is supported widely by most mainstream browsers (including but not limited to, Chrome, Firefox, Edge). However, it is more suitable for “smaller” games, which does not have request for high-quality videos and audios. Due to the high-speed development of web game industry, Flash is not as popular as before.
3D support: Flash 11 introduces Stage3D, based on OpenGL ES 2.0.

2. HTML5 engines
HTML5 has been quickly supported by more and more browsers. Compared to Flash, its compatibility is much better. Also, the consumption of system resources has been reduced. The general trend is that HTML5 is going to replace Flash gradually in the marketspace.
3D support: WebGL

3. Unreal 3/4
Unreal engines have been well-known for its products due to high-quality videos and audios. However, too high quality in graphics and sounds may not be appropriate for web-based games due to long loading time and pressure on the server. Nevertheless, it is attractive not only due to the perfect quality in graphics but it is free and open-source as well. 
3D support: WebGL

3. Unity 3D
Unity is a powerful game engine with huge success. It supports a lot of platforms, including Windows, OSX, Linux, Wii U, Xbox360, Android, iOS, Windows Phone and web browsers. In addition, just a few weeks ago, Unity Technology has announced their plan of “Free Unity for Education!”. More details can be seen at http://unity3d.com/freeforedu. Unity has well-maintained documentation and online tutorials.
